# Overview
This is a project to practice grid and flexbox in css and learn to control the flow of content in a layout using these two layout modules. This project is a 2 page dummy blog website where-in the homepage of the website shows 6 blog cards and a "continue reading" button at the end of every card. As we click on "continue reading" button it redirects us to second page of the website which is in the format of a dummy blog , this page is common to all the 6 blog cards shown on the homepage, means whichever card's button is clicked, it will redirect to the same common page.

Also learned and implemented responsive web designs in this project. Used the 'media-queries' to make this project responsive.

# My Leanings
I learned how to use grid and flexbox with each other efficiently and design layouts. This makes our job as a developer very easy to control the flow of content on the website/page. <br>
Became comfortable with 'repeat()' in the grid which saved me some time and efforts. <br>
Also became comfortable with using the media-queries to make the design responive.
